## Introduction

The Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model provides a framework for designing concurrent systems. This implementation aims to leverage CSP principles using the C programming language, making it easier for developers to build concurrent applications. 

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Supports multiple processes running in parallel.
- **Communication**: Processes can communicate through channels.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance in concurrent execution.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duongocho/aut_os_workshop.git
cd aut_os_workshop
```

After cloning, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Duongocho/aut_os_workshop/releases). 

Make sure to download and execute the appropriate files to run the project.

## Usage

To use the Go CSP implementation, you will need to include the relevant headers and link against the necessary libraries. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a simple concurrent process:

```c
#include "csp.h"

void process1() {
    // Your code for process 1
}

void process2() {
    // Your code for process 2
}

int main() {
    csp_init();
    csp_spawn(process1);
    csp_spawn(process2);
    csp_run();
    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes the CSP environment, spawns two processes, and runs them concurrently.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the Go CSP implementation in C:

### Example 1: Simple Communication

```c
#include "csp.h"

void sender(csp_channel_t *channel) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        csp_send(channel, &i, sizeof(i));
    }
}

void receiver(csp_channel_t *channel) {
    int value;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        csp_receive(channel, &value, sizeof(value));
        printf("Received: %d\n", value);
    }
}

int main() {
    csp_channel_t channel;
    csp_channel_init(&channel);
    
    csp_spawn(sender, &channel);
    csp_spawn(receiver, &channel);
    csp_run();
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Process Synchronization

```c
#include "csp.h"

void worker(csp_channel_t *sync_channel) {
    // Perform some work
    csp_send(sync_channel, NULL, 0); // Notify completion
}

int main() {
    csp_channel_t sync_channel;
    csp_channel_init(&sync_channel);
    
    csp_spawn(worker, &sync_channel);
    csp_receive(&sync_channel, NULL, 0); // Wait for completion
    printf("Worker finished.\n");
    
    csp_run();
    return 0;
}
```
